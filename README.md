# cmangos-kubernetes

This is a repository that gets classic cmangos with cmangos-db up and running with some modified configuration on Kubernetes.

This source is built with AI = ON, which means the PlayerBot is active and can be used.

You will need to have the maps, vmaps, mmaps, dbc already and then map them in the deployment file for mangos.
